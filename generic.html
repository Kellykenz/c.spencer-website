								<h3>COMFORT SPENCER</h3>
								<p>I'm Coach Comfort Spencer, founder of C.Spencer Tennis Pro Concepts - a passionate tennis coach, national player, and certified PTR & ITF professional dedicated to shaping the next generation of tennis champions.</p>
								<p>My tennis journey began long before I became a coach - as young girl with big dreams, a racket, and relentless determination. From those early days on court to representing Nigeria at international tournaments, tennis has always been more than a sport to me; it's been a calling. Over the years, I've had the privilege of transforming that passion into purpose - coaching kids, adults, and aspiring professionals to develop not just skills, but the mindset of winners.</p>
								<hr />

								<h4>My coaching philosophy</h4>
								<p>At C.Spencer Tennis Pro Concepts, I believe every player - regardless of age or experience - carries a spark of greatness. My approach is built on <i>*Personalized training tailored to each player's strengths and pace. *Fun engaging lessons that make learning exciting for kids and adults alike. *Strong focus on fundamentals, discipline, and mindset</i> - the foundation of champions</i></p>
								<p>Whether you're picking up a racket for the first time or training to compete, my goal is to help you unlock your <b>potential</b> and fall in love with the process of growth.</p>
